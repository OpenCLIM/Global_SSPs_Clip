  summary: >
    The second model in the workflow designed to crop global ssp datasets to a specific country.
    This model takes the global ssp datasets and crops the data to the country of interest.
    The raster data is then aggregated to the local authority level and a gpkg file is produced.
    This shows the population change per LAD for future projections.
